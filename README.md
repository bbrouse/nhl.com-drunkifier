nhl.com-drunkifier
==================

Chrome extension that changes the team logos on nhl.com to more drunk-friendly versions.

Thanks to reddit user [goalstopper28](http://www.reddit.com/user/goalstopper28) for the team logos.

The thread in question that [these nhl logos are from](http://imgur.com/a/QM6qb#0) is [located here](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1hy0sb/i_made_alternate_logos_for_the_30_nhl_teams/)

*Note: this is sure to break if nhl.com changes their css.*
